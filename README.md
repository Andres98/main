> This is Open Source global community project that is targeted at FIGHTING against COVID-19 TOGETHER. The only guideline for Opeb Covid19 Project is to build tools and applications that enable others to fight against the Coronavirus.

**We Are At War**
As you are aware the world is experience a generational event going though a global pandemic that will have numerous impacts on society as we know it. It is for this reason we would like to come together to help FIGHT COVID-19 by any means necessary.

**To ALL Communities**
We believe in the ingenuity, intelligence, and brilliance of those in the community. That is why we are seeking that this community comes together to help build solutions that will help address the challenges we face not only today, but in the future.

## Getting Started

**As a researcher identify and document:**
- Reliable data sources
- Supporting publications and research
- Use Cases
- Models
- Add these to README.md or build more .markdown documents on COVID-19 Repository

**As a developer identify, document and build:**
- ETL data pipelines (ex. Kafka, Python micro service)
- Scripts or tools (ex. pyCOVID)
- Dashboards (ex. Qlick, Vizlib)
- Applications (ex. Flutter, React)

**A Few Examples**:
* CV-19, an open source “Vulnerability Index” https://github.com/closedloop-ai/cv19index
* pyCovid, a python package to grab case data (developed by local UofM student) https://github.com/sudharshan-ashok/pycovid
* Coronavirus Visualizations, here are a collection of a few https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/coronavirus
* Sample covid projects, https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TLUcYR-CqxTGzw-g5Ap2yzh-b2WZMrrr
*This isn’t an extensive list but a few ideas to spark an idea. It could be as simple as providing clean data, researching data, or deriving new data for others to use.*
